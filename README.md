# Project 1: Tetris!
![Snapshots showing light and dark modes of Tetris games in play!](assets/images/mobile.png)

I recreated the beloved game of Tetris as a tribute for all the time I dedicated to its art during my college classes. This web-based browser game can be played on both computers and mobile devices.

The objective of the game is to clear as many lines as you can with the blocks provided to you. Blocks appear at the top of the board and automatically drop down towards the bottom. As the user, you are able to shift or rotate the block using either set keyboard inputs or on-screen buttons for the mobile application. The game is over once no further blocks can be placed on the board.
